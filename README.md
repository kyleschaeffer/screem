Screem is a static single-page web application. Build the web application using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
# Build in dev/watch mode & launch local dev server
yarn dev

# Build the app in production mode
yarn build
```

Be sure to run in production mode before making any pull requests, as the `docs` folder is used by GitHub to host all content for [screem.io](https://screem.io/).
